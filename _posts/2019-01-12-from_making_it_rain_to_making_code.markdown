I have been involved with the internet since it was a baby. Really, I have. I know that you are probalby saying to yourself...Dude, this guy is old. Well, yes and no. I am 43 years old. Let me give you a little back story. 

When I was about 7 years old, my father came home with a computer. This computer is not like the computers you know today. This device was just a keyboard. You had to hook it up to the TV and the storage or hard drive was cassette tapes. The moment he hooked it up to our TV and turned it on, I was hooked! I waould sit for hours watching him learn to operate the machine to years later creating one of the first remote backup software available on the internet. 

I got my first taste of working on the web by helping my dad setup his website and handle marketing the software. I created everything...from the website to the instruction booklets for the software. I was in highschool and was working for a startup!! I entered the military shrtly after graduating highschool. Upon getting out, I went back to work for my father.  This time, I started my own department. Internet marketing was starting to take off and I had experienceat it. As there was not many jobs out there for someone that could shoot down aircraft. 

Over the years, I taught myself everything. SEO, PPC, on-page optimization, off-page optimization, keyword research, you get the point. I became a master. I learned a little HTML and CSS along the way as I found that it was important to know this. About a year ago, I left my father's comany and began working for a very well known law firm. I have gotten to the point that the website framework tht I have been using is limited to say the least. So, I have decided to learn to become a web developer. My hopes are to become independent of plug and play web design. So Flat iron has become my first step in that process. Let this journey begin...
